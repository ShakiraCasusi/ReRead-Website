1. **Download or clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the folder** in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. **Locate** the `index.html` file.
4. **Open** `index.html` in your web browser (double-click or right-click and choose "Open with...").
5. The landing page should display as designed.

## Code Comments

- Both `index.html` and `styles.css` are **thoroughly commented**.
- Comments clearly mark each section and describe the purpose of code blocks for easy navigation and understanding.

---

## Preparation for JavaScript and Bootstrap Integration

- The codebase is structured to allow **easy integration of JavaScript and Bootstrap** in the future.
- Placeholder comments are included in `index.html` where JavaScript functions or Bootstrap components may be added.
- No JavaScript or Bootstrap code is present yet.

---

## Placeholders for Future JavaScript

- In `index.html`, look for comments such as:
  - `<!-- JS: Placeholder for future script -->`
  - `<!-- Future: Add Bootstrap components here -->`
- These indicate where dynamic features or enhancements will be implemented.
